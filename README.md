CS 340 - Databases Project


# Project Synopsis:
No Probllama! is the system used by the No Probllama Animal Rescue. They started
out by rescuing llamas, then expanded to accept any animal in need of a home. They
currently have the ability to accommodate approximately 50-100 animals, depending on
the species and their individual size and habitat requirements.

No Probllama! has a website with a database back end that allows them to keep track of
their current animals, feeding requirements for all of the different species they house,
and any animal sponsorships.

The website will include an easy-to-use interface where you can simply add a new
animal to your database by inputting in their name, their species, and their birthdate. A
unique animal ID will automatically be assigned to each new animal so they are always
accounted for. Youâ€™ll be able to search the database by animal name or species. No
Probllama! will also keep track of feeding requirements for each species, including the
type of food, how much, and how often they should be fed each food type. There will be
a search option on the website to search by animal species, so the caretakers will know
the appropriate amounts to feed each animal. The food type/amount/frequency can be
updated for each animal in the database to adjust the feeding guidelines for any animal.
No Probllama! also allows the rescue to keep track of their donors, and if any of the
donors choose to sponsor any specific animal(s). Like the animal ID, each donor will
automatically be given a unique donor ID so they can be found easily. The top 15
sponsorships will be displayed on the page so you know who your biggest donors are.

No Probllama! makes tracking and feeding your rescued animals No Probllama!
